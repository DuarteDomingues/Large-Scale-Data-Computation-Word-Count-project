This work uses the MapReduce programming model to solve large-scale computational problems (Big Data). 

This work presents a word count project using Apache Hadoop for analyzing a set of documents by counting the frequency of n-grams. 

The project also utilizes compressed data, collects statistical data using counters, and make use of a distributed cache.
